## The Final Solution



Welcome the Data Inbalance Team

The main goal of our project is to combat huge problem that prevents us from using machine leanring methods in areas where we lack data.
In particular Temporal graphs could be greatly improved if we could figure out a way to deal with its intrinsic data imbalance.

 
Our team consists of 2 Datalogy@[Faculty of Computer Science and Management](http://wiz.pwr.edu.pl/en/) students:
* Hubert Jegierski
